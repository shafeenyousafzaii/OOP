/*Start with the date structure in Exercise 3 in the previous practice questions and transform it into a date class.
 Its member data should consist of three ints: month, day, and year. It should also
have two member functions: getdate(), which allows the user to enter a date in 12/31/02 format, and showdate(), which displays the date.
