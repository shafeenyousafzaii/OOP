/*Imagine an enumerated type with values that indicate an employee type within an organization:

enum etype { laborer, secretary, manager, accountant, executive,researcher };


Write a program that first allows the user to specify a type by entering its first letter ( ‘l’ , ‘s’ , ‘m’ , and so on), then stores the type chosen as a value of a variable of type enum etype , and finally displays the complete word for this type.

Enter employee type (first letter only) laborer, secretary, manager, accountant, executive, researcher: a
Employee type is accountant.

You’ll probably need two switch statements: one for input and one for output.
