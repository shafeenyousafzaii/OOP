/* In the heyday of the British Empire, Great Britain used a monetary system based on pounds, shillings, and pence.
 There were 20 shillings to a pound, and 12 pence to a shilling.
 The notation for this old system used the pound sign, £, and two decimal points, so that, for example, £5.2.8 meant 5 pounds, 2 shillings, and 8 pence. (Pence is the plural of a penny.) 
 The new monetary system, introduced in the 1950s, consists of only pounds and pence, with 100 pence to a pound (like U.S. dollars and cents). We’ll call this new system decimal pounds. 
Thus £5.2.8 in the old notation is £5.13 in decimal pounds (actually £5.1333333).
Create a structure called sterling that stores money amounts in the old-style British system. 
The members could be called pounds , shillings , and pence , all of type int .
 The program should ask the user to enter a money amount in new-style decimal pounds (type double ), convert it to the old-style system, store it in a variable of type struct sterling , and then display this amount in pounds-shillings-pence format.
